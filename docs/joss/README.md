# JOSS Assets

`workflow.png` is a placeholder. Replace it with a workflow diagram before JOSS submission.

Suggested workflow figure:

1. Export a diagram from the mindmap or architecture page.
2. Save as `docs/joss/workflow.png` at 150-300 DPI.
3. Ensure the figure includes data ingestion, QC, preprocessing, modeling, and reporting steps.
