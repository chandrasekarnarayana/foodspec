# Domains Overview

foodspec supports multiple food science domains:

- **Oils**: full authentication workflow (see tutorial).
- **Heating degradation**: ratios vs time with regression and ANOVA.
- **QC/novelty detection**: one-class methods to flag suspect spectra.
- **Dairy, meat, microbial**: reusable templates that apply common preprocessing and classification workflows; bring your own datasets and labels.

All domain workflows reuse the same preprocessing, feature extraction, and chemometrics foundations to stay consistent and reproducible.
