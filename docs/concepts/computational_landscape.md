# Computational Landscape

FoodSpec sits between general spectroscopy toolkits and domain-specific food science workflows.

## Positioning
- **General spectroscopy**: HyperSpy, Spectral Python, ChemoSpec (R)
- **Food-specific workflows**: FoodSpec bridges domain protocols, QC, and reporting

## Why FoodSpec
- Protocol-driven reproducibility
- QC and trust outputs built-in
- Food matrix workflows (oils, heating, mixtures)
