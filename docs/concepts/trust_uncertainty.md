# Trust & Uncertainty

FoodSpec treats calibration, conformal prediction, and interpretability as core outputs.

## Calibration
- Platt and isotonic scaling
- Temperature scaling for neural models

## Conformal prediction
- Mondrian and class-conditional conformal sets

## Interpretability
- Coefficients and feature importances
- Marker peak explanations
