## What is FoodSpec?
FoodSpec is a protocol-driven toolkit for Raman/FTIR and hyperspectral imaging in food science. It focuses on edible oils and fried matrices (e.g., chips), covering oil discrimination, thermal stability, and oil–chips matrix effects. The engine bundles preprocessing, harmonization, Ratio-Quality (RQ) analysis, protocol execution, reporting, and prediction into reproducible pipelines usable via GUI, CLI, or web API.

## Who is this for?
- Food scientists, QA/QC analysts, and lab technicians running spectral workflows.
- Data/ML practitioners who need reproducible, protocol-based pipelines with validation and reporting.
- Developers extending protocols, vendor loaders, plugins, or deploying FoodSpec services.
