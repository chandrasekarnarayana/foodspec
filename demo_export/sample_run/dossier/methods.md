# Methods

## Data Acquisition
Extra virgin olive oil samples (n=250) were analyzed using visible-near infrared spectroscopy.

## Preprocessing
Spectra were normalized using Standard Normal Variate (SNV) and baseline-corrected
using polynomial (order 3) fitting.

## Multivariate Analysis
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied with:
- 5 latent components
- 5-fold cross-validation
- 70% training / 30% test split
